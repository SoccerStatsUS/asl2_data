##### summary

The second American Soccer League, which lasted from 1933 to 1983, was a semi-professional league based in the Northeastern United States, particularly in the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Kearny, NJ. As one of the longest-running leagues in the history of the United States, it offers an invaluable perspective on the evolution of soccer in American between the collapse of the first ASL and the rise of the NASL. 

Unfortunately, no comprehensive statistics or records for the league exist; this repository is an attempt to recover the history of the league, primarily through newspaper and league publications, as well as collecting and combining the data compiled by earlier researchers.
